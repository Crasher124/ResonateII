# ResonateII
Source to ResonateII, don't do anything dumb. I'm only reuploading it, orginally made by Gaia.

To Justquant:
I'm sorry you had an awful couple of years, hope things are going well for you. since it only took you a mere 18hrs to take down the source code you uploaded yourself, I took the librity of not only keeping a copy, but to share it amongst Malware REs. If you don't feel comfortable with this been public, tell me (under issues), I will listen. 


To Mareware reverse engineers:
Feel free to reassemble this, although Resonate do attempt to download files of a server (according to its writer), and that server no longer exisis, therefore it may not work as intended. 

P.S: the writer has gone through theries of trouble and is no longer reachable by normal means, that is unless you are a part of Gaia, which I'm NOT. Thus from what I can see, those files on the server will be forever lost. Maybe people good enough at malware RE can make their own interpretations of the malware, and re-write its code? I don't know, but good luck to you all.

To MS Malware submission team and local internet law re-enforcers:
This malware has no spreading routine, so if it spreads, some genius has hevily modified it.

# ResonateII

because if you ask a woman like me to release something enough she eventually gives in

note: ResonateII does attempt to retrieve files from a website that hasnt existed for a very long time now. i still have the files, and i will likely throw them into this repo whenever i get around to finding them.
